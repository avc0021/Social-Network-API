# Description

Given a social network API
when I enter the command to invoke the application
then my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
when I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
when I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
when I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
then I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

# Features

Node Js, JavaScript, Express Js. Mongo DB, and Mongoose

# Install

To run this application `npm init` , `npm install express` , and `npm install mongoose` in the command line.

# Usage

As a social media startup
I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.
